## Abstract
This research focuses on addressing blind spots in autonomous vehicle systems, where traditional sensors may fail to detect obstacles effectively. The study integrates **image processing** and **deep learning** techniques to improve vehicle detection and trajectory prediction. By utilizing **YOLO V8** for object detection and **DeepSORT** for tracking, the system enhances situational awareness and safety in autonomous driving.

The system converts images from an **external camera system** into a **Bird's Eye View (BEV)** perspective for accurate vehicle positioning. The **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** model predicts vehicle movement based on detected trajectory patterns, reducing collision risks in complex environments.

## Features
- **Real-time vehicle detection** using YOLO V8
- **Trajectory prediction** with ANN
- **Image processing** for blind-spot elimination
- **Sensor fusion with external camera systems**
- **Automated collision prevention system**

## Dataset
The dataset consists of real-world traffic recordings and simulation data used for training the detection and tracking models. 

## Results
- Improved **blind-spot detection** accuracy
- Faster **real-time tracking** of surrounding vehicles
- Effective **collision avoidance decision-making**

## Future Work
- **Sensor Fusion Enhancement**: Integrating LiDAR and RADAR for better accuracy.
- **Night-Time Performance Optimization**: Improving detection in low-light environments.
- **Field Testing**: Deploying the system on real autonomous vehicles.
